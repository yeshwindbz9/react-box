# Reactive Notes from namaste JS

## Why React
React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces that was developed by Facebook. The name “React” was chosen because it is meant to help developers build user interfaces that are fast and responsive, or “reactive”. The library was designed to “react” to changes in data. When data in a React application changes, the components that depend on that data are automatically updated, which allows for efficient and seamless updates to the user interface.

### Library vs Framework
A library is essentially a set of functions that you can call, these days usually organized into classes. Each call does some work and returns control to the client.

A framework embodies some abstract design, with more behavior built in. In order to use it you need to insert your behavior into various places in the framework either by subclassing or by plugging in your own classes. The framework's code then calls your code at these points.

### What's a CDN?
A Content Delivery Network (CDN) is a geographically distributed group of servers that caches content close to end users. A CDN allows for the quick transfer of assets needed for loading Internet content, including HTML pages, JavaScript files, stylesheets, images, and videos. 

To use React in your project using CDN, you can add script tags to load the latest versions of React and ReactDOM from unpkg, which is a CDN service that hosts npm packages.

## Things in a react app
### NPM's full form is censored

npm is not a node package manager! It does not have a fullform, yes it helps manage packages, but does not stand for node package manager. npm is the world's largest Software Registry. All the libraries and utilities that we need in a react/react project comes from npm.

- npm init: creates a package.json file that contains the confirguation for our npm app.
- npm install <package_name>: fetches and installs the package_name from npm.
    - npm i: shorthand for install.
    - npm install: without an argument, it will install all the required modules from package.json
    - types of dependencies we can install
        - dev dependency: required in a development phase
        - normal dependency: used in development and production
- npm uninstall <package_name>: used to uninstall the package_name from our app.

### what is the Package.json file

A package.json file is a manifest file for your React app that lists the packages and versions your project depends on.
- lists the packages your project depends on
- specifies versions of a package that your project can use.
    - ^ before version: will automatically update the package to the next minor version (preferred)
    - ~ before version: will automatically update the package to the next major version
- makes your build reproducible, and therefore easier to share with other developers.

### Package-lock.json is different than Package.json

package-lock.json is a file that is automatically generated by npm when it modifies either the node_modules tree or package.json file.
- It is used to keep track of the exact dependency tree at any given time (unlike package.json which has ^, ~ or *)
- keeps a hash code to verify if the local and production version are using the same version of package. This means that you can guarantee the dependencies for other developers or prod releases, etc
- It also has a mechanism to lock the tree but generally will regenerate if package.json changes
-  It describes which version of every single package you have installed, That’s why it’s so much longer than package.json


### node_modules: the home of all the project modules

node_modules is a directory that contains all the external dependencies of a React app. When you install a package using npm or yarn, it gets downloaded and stored in the node_modules directory. This directory is created by npm or yarn and is used to store all the packages that your app depends on.

The node_modules directory is not included in the version control system (such as Git) because it can be recreated from scratch at any time by running npm install or yarn install command, thus no need to upload the whole directory, just keep a copy of the package.json and package-lock.json file.

### NPX and how is it related to NPM?
npx is a tool for executing Node packages. <br>
npx is a command-line interface tool that comes with npm. It allows you to run an arbitrary command from an npm package, in a similar context as running it via npm run. You can specify multiple packages to be provided in the PATH of the executed command, and use different options and flags to customize the behavior

### Parcel
Parcel is a web application bundler that can be used to build single or multi-page React applications 1. It provides a first-class development experience with Fast Refresh and supports JSX, TypeScript, Flow, and many styling methodologies out of the box. [helps us build a production ready webpage]
- Dev Build
- Bundles all code - also can have different prod and development build
- Differential bundling - bundled for different platform (support old browsers)
- Local Server
- Hot Module Replacement
- File watching algorithm - C++
- Caching - gives faster build using caching
- Hashing - uses consistent hashing
- Image optimization (one of the constiliest operations when loading a page)
- Minification and Compression of files
- Diagnostics and Error handling
- Hosting on HTTPS
- Tree shaking - removes unused code

### Note: 

- Bundler is used to package our app, create react app uses webpack and babel behind the scenes to bundle all out html, css and js files.
- A package can depend on other small packages, thus there can be multiple package dependencies in a project, this is known as transitive dependencies.
- every dependency inside node_modules directory has its own set of package.json and package-lock.json
- node_modules directory has a lot of libraries that are huge, these can be re-installed using package.json, so add /node_modules to .gitignore to ignore them
- CDN links are not a preferred way to get react into projects
    - it's a costly operation (network calls)
    - we have to update the url with a different version of react frequently (no version manager)
- React is not the only module that makes your webpage fast, it's also modules like Parcel. React and Parcel go hand in hand.
- npx parcel build index.html: builds a dev build
    - remember to remove main from package.json
