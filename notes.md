# Reactive Notes from namaste JS

### Why React
React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces that was developed by Facebook. The name “React” was chosen because it is meant to help developers build user interfaces that are fast and responsive, or “reactive”. The library was designed to “react” to changes in data. When data in a React application changes, the components that depend on that data are automatically updated, which allows for efficient and seamless updates to the user interface.

### Library vs Framework
A library is essentially a set of functions that you can call, these days usually organized into classes. Each call does some work and returns control to the client.

A framework embodies some abstract design, with more behavior built in. In order to use it you need to insert your behavior into various places in the framework either by subclassing or by plugging in your own classes. The framework's code then calls your code at these points.

### What's a CDN?
A Content Delivery Network (CDN) is a geographically distributed group of servers that caches content close to end users. A CDN allows for the quick transfer of assets needed for loading Internet content, including HTML pages, JavaScript files, stylesheets, images, and videos. 

To use React in your project using CDN, you can add script tags to load the latest versions of React and ReactDOM from unpkg, which is a CDN service that hosts npm packages.
